Simple Discord bot written in Python.

Scrapes for UCF Parking info from a public UCF site using BeautifulSoup, provides users in a Discord server the bot has been added to with number of free spots in each UCF garage. Also provides a quick summary of the average status of garages in the bot's status field.
