Standalone scraper code, used this to learn how to use BS4 before implementing it into a Discord bot.

Scraping is a little bit hacky and depends on the fact that the website happens to have \<strong\> tags on the information I needed. Also does not read the total spots available, these numbers are hardcoded both here and into the bot (however, it is unlikely that the total number of spots in a a garage can change).
